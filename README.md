# 17637-Wordish

In the actual Wordle game, a player tries to guess a five-letter “target” word. The New York Times newspaper selects a new target word every day. The player has up to six guesses to find the target word. The fewer guesses the better.

Not knowing what the target word is, a player will make a guess and the game will provide feedback on the correctness of the guess to help the user figure out the target word. Each guessed letter:
● in the target word and in the correct position will be displayed with a green background,
● in the target word but not in the correct position will be displayed with a yellow background,
● not in the target word will be displayed with a gray background.
A player wins the game if the target word is found in six or fewer guesses. (The player loses after making six incorrect guesses.)
